It reminds me of a course I took in Economics of Public Finance, specifically on the subtopic of Pigouvian taxes — essentially a tax placed on activities that create negative costs to others: an entrepreneur may wish to build a factory next to a residential area and a whole host of ‘costs’ may arise which the firm does not pay directly, such as unpleasant fumes causing perma-smelly-backyards for nearby residents (more generally, a negative externality).</description>
