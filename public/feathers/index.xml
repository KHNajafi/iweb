      <description>“The rate at which things change is greater than our rate to learn” — Anon
 This was a wonderful tidbit I heard while attending a recent conference, and it’s truly unfortunate that I cannot recall who said it! Nonetheless, on the quote itself:
Aside from the obvious, I find it tells us something a bit more implicit, and arguably more profound: Obtaining newly created knowledge is good and well, but how well do you really understand something?</description>

      <description>“As the area of our knowledge increases, so too, does the perimeter of our ignorance” — Neil DeGrasse Tyson
 One of the many quotables from one of the great science communicators. A key reason in selecting this quote is due to its graphical representation.
The visualization above shows how increasing area (\(A\)) leads to an increase in perimeter (\(C\)) by virtue of the increase in radius (\(r\)) which is the key component of both equations.</description>

      <description>Snippet of the menu for an (intentionally) anonymous sushi restaurant in Toronto, and all I can think is: A literal tax on happiness
It reminds me of a course I took in Economics of Public Finance, specifically on the subtopic of Pigouvian taxes — essentially a tax placed on activities that create negative costs to others: an entrepreneur may wish to build a factory next to a residential area and a whole host of ‘costs’ may arise which the firm does not pay directly, such as unpleasant fumes causing perma-smelly-backyards for nearby residents (more generally, a negative externality).</description>
