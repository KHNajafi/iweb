<p><em>“The rate at which things change is greater than our rate to learn”</em> — Anon</p>

<p>This was a wonderful tidbit I heard while attending a recent conference, and it’s truly unfortunate that I cannot recall who said it! Nonetheless, on the quote itself:</p>
<p>Aside from the obvious, I find it tells us something a bit more implicit, and arguably more profound: Obtaining newly created knowledge is good and well, but <em>how well do you really understand something?</em> Are there topics you have a mastery for? An awareness of new ideas, models, etc is most useful if it can further one’s understanding or capabilities <em>in their core domains</em>. Jack-of-all-trades etc etc, as the other saying goes..</p>
