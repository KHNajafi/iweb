Khalil H Najafi is formally a data scientist, from the domains of econometrics and applied statistics.  His approach is very much grounded in the scientific method, focusing on generating and prioritizing the right questions $ [problem^{forward} > solution_{backward}] $ then analyzing all relevant data (including qualitative factors) to evaluate hypotheses, and most importantly, begin the process of creating knowledge.  

Outside of speaking in the 3<sup>rd</sup> person, I am a huge fan of Batman, hats, football (as in _football_ football; go City), and most of all, my wife & two bambinos :)
