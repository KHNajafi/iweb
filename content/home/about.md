# Biography

Khalil H Najafi is formally a data scientist, born from the domains of econometrics and applied statistics.  His approach is very much grounded in the scientific method, focusing on generating and prioritizing the right questions (which can be tremendously difficult itself) then analyzing all relevant data (including qualitative factors) to evaluate hypotheses, and most importantly, begin the process of creating knowledge.  

Outside of speaking in the 3<sup>rd</sup> person, I am a huge fan of Batman, hats, football (as in _football_ football; go City), and most of all, my wife & two bambinos :)
